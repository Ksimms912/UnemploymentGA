After creating the heat map gif of the unemployment
rate by county in Georgia, it was apparent that
there was a huge spike in unemployment rates
beginning in 2008 and it begins to normalize in 2012. 
This lines up with the recession. However, even after
unemployment rates start to decrease again, they do 
not get back to the low levels that they were at 
before 2008. 

After looking at the emissions data from the
state of Georgia, it appears that a decrease in
emissions seems to line up with the Unemployment
spike from 2008-2012. However, there is a spike 
from 2008-2009, where total emissions are 161.63
for 2008 and the total emissions for 2009 were
170.95. In 2010, it decreases dramatically to 
155.51. It keeps decreasing from 2011 onwards. 
Further research will be needed to know why but
this could be due to some plants shutting down
after the recession. 

Going further, I would like to make my own dataset
that compares the emissions by county and the
unemployment by county. I unfortunately ran into
trouble with formatting the emissions by county data
so I had to use emissions for the state overall.
