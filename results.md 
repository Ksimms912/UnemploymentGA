After creating the heat map gif of the unemployment
rate by county in Georgia, it was apparent that
there was a huge spike in unemployment rates
from 2008-2010. This lines up with the recession.

After looking at the emissions data from the
state of Georgia, it appears that a decrease in
emissions seems to line up with the Unemployment
spike from 2008-2010.

Going further, I would like to make my own dataset
that compares the emissions by county and the
unemployment by county. I unfortunately ran into
trouble with formatting the emissions by county data
so I had to use emissions for the state overall.
